# EMG_Analysis
Code for extraction of muscle synergies from EMG activity. The rShiftNMF algorithm decomposes the EMG into a set of neural commands (H) and activation pattern (W), with activation delays (T) between different muscle activations. Accounting for these delays, T, is important in analysis of EMG activity from spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.
